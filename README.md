# Simulations-in-R
Stat-420 Course, Summer 2018

## Overview
In this project we will perform three simulation studies related to linear regression.

Study 1 will look at the significance of regression test in multiple regression.
Study 2 will evaluate Test RMSE as a metric for selecting a model.
Study 3 will investigate the power of the significance of regression test for SLR.
