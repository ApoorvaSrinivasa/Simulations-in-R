# Simulations-in-R
Stat-420 Course, Summer 2018

## Overview
In this project we performed three simulation studies to better understand different aspects of linear regression.

- Study 1 looks at the significance of regression test in multiple regression.
- Study 2 evaluates Test RMSE as a metric for selecting a model.
- Study 3 investigates the power of the significance of regression test for SLR.
